# WallofHope
As a personal project, I created a personal and therapeutical writing app. The wall collects all of your worries, displaying them one at a time. But like memory, we tend to forget it after a while. 

To mimic the interaction we have with worries, stress and anxiety, I wanted to create visual space of Hope. Where you can fill in everything you are worried about, and as it will disappear from the wall, you are able to let go of them. Not to let them take control of you, but rather manage forward.
